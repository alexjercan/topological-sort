# Topological Sort

Just a toy project to implement topological sorting.

### Quickstart

##### Python

```console
python main.py
```

##### Haskell

```console
ghc main.hs && ./main
```

### Details

The format of the input is presented in `input.txt`. It will be a list of
dependencies marked with `->` to indicate the order. The output will be a DAG
that will show the order of execution for the plan.
